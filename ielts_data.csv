Overall, it can be seen that donated food accounted for the majority of the income, while program services accounted for the most expenditure. Total revenue sources just exceeded outgoings.

In detail, donated food provided most of the revenue for the charity, at 86%. Similarly, with regard to expenditures, one category, program services, accounted for nearly all of the outgoings, at 95.8%. 

The other categories were much smaller. Community contributions, which were the second largest revenue source, brought in 10.4% of overall income, and this was followed by program revenue, at 2.2%. Investment income, government grants, and other income were very small sources of revenue, accounting for only 0.8% combined.

There were only two other expenditure items, fundraising and management and general, accounting for 2.6% and 1.6% respectively.

* Band 5: The response has frequent error-free sentences, but there are noticeable errors in grammar and punctuation.

Overall, the response receives a score of 6.5, which falls within the Band 6 range.","Here is the grammatical analysis of the given Task 1 response:

**Tense usage for trends: 80%**

The response uses the present simple tense (e.g., ""The map illustrates"", ""It can be seen"", ""it will be"") to describe the current situation and general information. However, when describing potential future actions (e.g., ""If it is built here""), the response uses the first conditional (if + present simple, will + infinitive).

**Comparative structures: 90%**

The response provides a comparison between the two sites (S1 and S2) by describing their locations and proximity to other features in the town. The comparison is done using prepositional phrases (e.g., ""just north of the city centre"", ""fairly close to the city centre""), possessive adjectives (e.g., ""of the city centre"", ""of the estate""), and adverbial phrases (e.g., ""next to"", ""close to"").

**Passive voice: 70%**

The response uses passive voice in a few instances, such as ""The map illustrates"" and ""It can be seen"". However, it also uses active voice consistently throughout the description, which makes it easy to follow.

**Articles with data: 80%**

The response uses articles (the, a) correctly to provide specific examples and to describe general information. However, there is room for improvement in using articles consistently throughout the description.

**Prepositions with trends: 85%**

The response uses prepositions (e.g., ""next to"", ""close to"", ""near to"") to describe the relationships between different locations and features in the town. However, there are a few instances where prepositions could be used more precisely or consistently.

**Other comments:**

* The response is clear and easy to follow, but it could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence structures.
* There is a lack of comparison and contrast between the two sites, which could make the description more engaging and effective.
* Some sentences could be shortened or rephrased for better clarity and concision.

**Specific grammar usage:**

* Present simple: 80%
* First conditional: 80%
* Past tense: 0% (not used)
* Future tense: 10% (used in one sentence, ""If it is built here"")
* Passive voice: 30% (used in two sentences)
* Articles (the, a): 80%
* Prepositions: 85% (used correctly in most instances)
* Comparative structures: 90% (used correctly in most instances)

Note: The percentages are subjective and based on my analysis. They indicate the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the grammar usage in the response.","Here's an analysis of the vocabulary used in the response, focusing on language for describing trends, comparison vocabulary, data reporting vocabulary, and graph/chart-specific terminology:

Language for describing trends:

* The response does not explicitly describe trends, but it does provide information about the two possible sites for the shopping mall. To improve, the writer could use phrases such as ""it appears that"" or ""it is evident from"" to describe the characteristics of each site.

Comparison vocabulary:

* The writer compares the two possible sites, highlighting their differences in terms of their proximity to housing estates, industrial areas, and the river. To improve, the writer could use more nuanced comparison vocabulary, such as ""in contrast,"" ""similarly,"" or ""differing from.""

Data reporting vocabulary:

* The response provides some basic information about the sites, but it does not use data reporting vocabulary such as ""according to,"" ""as shown in,"" or ""as illustrated by"" to present the information. To improve, the writer could use these phrases to introduce and describe the data.

Graph/chart-specific terminology:

* The response does not contain graph/chart-specific terminology, but since it is a Task 1 response, it should include vocabulary related to maps and diagrams. To improve, the writer could use phrases such as ""it can be seen from the map"" or ""as illustrated in the diagram.""

Suggestions for improvement with examples:

* Use more descriptive language to describe the trends and characteristics of each site: ""It appears from the map that S1 is strategically located, providing easy access for residents of the nearby housing estate and the city centre."" (Note: This sentence uses the phrase ""it appears from"" to describe the trend and ""strategically located"" to describe the characteristics of the site.)
* Use more nuanced comparison vocabulary: ""In contrast to S1, which is situated near a housing estate, S2 is close to an industrial area, making it a more suitable location for businesses."" (Note: This sentence uses the phrase ""in contrast to"" to compare the two sites.)
* Use data reporting vocabulary to present the information: ""According to the map, both sites are situated near the railway line and are relatively close to the city centre, as illustrated in the diagram."" (Note: This sentence uses the phrase ""according to"" to introduce the data and ""as illustrated in the diagram"" to describe it.)
* Use graph/chart-specific terminology to describe the map: ""As can be seen from the map, the city centre is located in the north and the river runs through the town, providing a natural boundary for the shopping mall's potential locations."" (Note: This sentence uses the phrase ""as can be seen from"" to describe the map and ""natural boundary"" to describe the river's role in the town.)","Here's the analysis and suggestions for improvement:

**Overview presence and quality**: The written response provides a brief overview of the graph analysis, but it does not accurately summarize the main points of the graph. The response mentions the two possible sites for a shopping mall, but it does not mention anything about the Golf Course & Park or the proportions of different land uses in Section S1 and S2. To improve, the response should provide a clear and concise summary of the main features of the graph.

**Key feature selection**: The written response focuses on the two possible sites for a shopping mall, which is not a key feature identified in the graph analysis. The graph analysis highlights the proportions of the Golf Course & Park, which is not mentioned in the written response. The response should have focused on the key features of the graph, such as the proportional areas of different land uses in Section S1 and S2.

**Data accuracy**: The written response does not accurately describe the graph analysis. For example, it says that the graph shows plans for a shopping mall in the city of Brandfield, but it does not mention Section S1 or S2, which are mentioned in the graph analysis. Additionally, the response does not mention the proportions of the Golf Course & Park, which is a key feature identified in the graph analysis. To improve, the response should accurately describe the graph analysis and its key features.

**Trend description completeness**: The written response does not describe any trends or patterns in the data. The graph analysis highlights the proportions of different land uses in Section S1 and S2, but the written response does not discuss these trends or patterns. To improve, the response should describe any notable trends or patterns in the data and how they relate to the topic at hand.

Suggestions for improvement:

* Provide a clear and concise summary of the main features of the graph analysis.
* Focus on the key features of the graph analysis, such as the proportional areas of different land uses in Section S1 and S2.
* Accurately describe the graph analysis and its key features.
* Describe any notable trends or patterns in the data and how they relate to the topic at hand.

Task Achievement: 6
The essay attempts to address the task, but it does not fully satisfy the requirements. The student mentions the two possible sites for the shopping mall, but the focus is on the location and surroundings rather than highlighting the key features of the graph. The student does not adequately explain the distribution of estates and the railway system in the region.

Comment for Task Achievement (6): The response only touches upon the key features of the graph, failing to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the data. The sentence structure is also relatively simple, which makes it difficult to fully convey the complexity of the graph.

Coherence and Cohesion: 7
The essay has a logical structure, with each paragraph focusing on one of the possible sites for the shopping mall. However, the transitions between paragraphs are not always smooth, and some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the text. The student uses some cohesive devices, such as transition words, but could improve the connections between sentences.

Comment for Coherence and Cohesion (7): The response has a clear overall structure, but the transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be more nuanced. Additionally, some sentences, such as the first sentence of the second paragraph, feel disconnected from the rest of the text.

Lexical Resource: 6
The student uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to convey their ideas, but the language is not particularly sophisticated or precise. The student uses some less common words, such as ""industrial estate"", but there are still some areas where the language could be improved, such as the description of the graph.

Comment for Lexical Resource (6): The response uses a sufficient range of vocabulary, but the language could be more precise and sophisticated. The student could benefit from using more varied and nuanced language to describe the graph and its features.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6
The essay contains some errors in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph lacks a subject, and the student uses some awkward sentence structures. However, the majority of sentences are correct, and the student shows a good sense of grammar and punctuation.

Comment for Grammatical Range and Accuracy (6): The response contains some errors in grammar and punctuation, which can detract from the clarity and effectiveness of the text. The student should strive to use more complex sentence structures and avoid errors in grammar and punctuation.

Overall, I would score the essay 6.5 out of 9.","Here's a grammatical analysis of the Task 1 response:

**Tense usage for trends: 80%**
The response mainly uses the present tense to describe the map and the locations, which is accurate. However, there are a few instances where the past tense could be used to describe trends or movements, such as the railway line. While not incorrect, using the present tense here (""which runs from the south east of the city to the north west"") might make the description more dynamic.

**Comparative structures: 90%**
The response uses a few comparative structures, such as ""just north"" and ""fairly close"". These are accurate and effective in describing the spatial relationships between the sites and other features. However, there is no direct comparison between the two sites, which might make the description less engaging.

**Passive voice: 60%**
The response uses the passive voice in a few instances, such as ""It can be seen that the two sites under consideration are..."" and ""There is a main road that runs through the city..."". While the passive voice is not incorrect, using more active constructions might make the description more dynamic.

**Articles with data: 70%**
The response uses articles correctly in most instances, except for a few places where the noun is not specific enough to take an article, such as ""the town"" instead of ""the city of Brandfield"". Additionally, some articles are used twice in close proximity, which might make the text less fluid.

**Prepositions with trends: 85%**
The response uses prepositions effectively to describe the relationships between the sites and other features, such as ""just north"", ""above"", and ""next to"". However, there is one instance where a preposition is used ambiguously (""which runs through the town""), which might make the description less clear.

**Other comments:**

* The response could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve its overall coherence and readability.
* There are a few sentences that could be rephrased for greater clarity, such as the sentence about the river, which is a bit long and complicated.
* The response could include more specific data or statistics to support its description of the sites and their benefits, which might make the description more persuasive.

Overall, the response is clear and descriptive, but could benefit from some refinements to its grammar and sentence structure to make it more engaging and effective.","**Language for describing trends:**
The response could benefit from more explicit language to describe trends, such as phrases like ""trend towards"", ""pattern of"", ""growing importance of"", or ""steady increase in"". For example, instead of simply stating ""there is a main road that runs through the city and is close to both sites"", the response could describe the trend towards accessible road access in the city by saying ""the city's infrastructure trend towards easy accessibility, with a main road bisecting the area and providing convenient connections to both potential sites"".

**Comparison vocabulary:**
The response could use more vocabulary for comparing and contrasting the two sites, such as ""in contrast"", ""notably"", ""remarkably"", or ""in stark contrast"". For example, instead of simply listing the features of each site, the response could compare and contrast them by saying ""While S1 is situated near a housing estate, providing easy access for residents, S2 is located near an industrial estate, which may pose environmental concerns"".

**Data reporting vocabulary:**
The response could incorporate more formal language typically used in reporting data, such as ""statistical analysis reveals"", ""according to available data"", or ""as revealed by the map"". For example, instead of simply stating ""there is a large golf course and park in the west of the town prevents this area from being available as a site"", the response could report the data by saying ""Statistical analysis reveals that the golf course and park in the west of the town occupy 20% of the available land, making it an unsuitable location for the shopping mall"".

**Graph/chart-specific terminology:**
There is limited graph/chart-specific terminology used in the response. The response could incorporate terms like ""distribution"", ""proximity"", or ""correlation"" to describe the relationship between the locations and features on the map.

**Suggestions for improvement with examples:**

1. Instead of simply stating ""the two sites under consideration are in the north and the south east of the town"", the response could use a more nuanced phrase like ""the map reveals a geographic distribution of two potential sites, one in the north and the other in the south east, highlighting the importance of location in the shopping mall's success"".
Example: ""The proposed shopping mall would be situated in the south east of the city, where [X] statistics reveal that 30% of the population resides, indicating a high demand for retail services"".

2. To make comparisons between the two sites, the response could use phrases like ""in contrast"" or ""notably"" to draw attention to the differences. For instance: ""While S1 is situated near a housing estate, in contrast, S2 is located near an industrial estate, which may pose environmental concerns"".
Example: ""Remarkably, S1 has easy road access, with [X] meters of proximity to the main road, whereas S2 is [X] meters away from the nearest road"".

3. To report data, the response could use formal language and incorporate statistics. For example: ""The map reveals that the golf course and park occupy [X]% of the available land, making it an unsuitable location for the shopping mall"".
Example: ""According to available data, the majority of residents in the city prefer shopping malls located in residential areas, which makes S1 a more attractive option"".

4. To incorporate graph/chart-specific terminology, the response could describe the relationship between the locations and features on the map, using terms like ""proximity"" or ""correlation"". For example: ""The map illustrates a correlation between the locations of the railway line and the housing estate, demonstrating the importance of accessible transportation for the shopping mall's success"".","Here's the analysis and suggestions for improvement:

**Overview presence and quality**: The written response does not adequately summarize the key features of the graph analysis. The response instead focuses on the planning of shopping malls in Brandfield, which is not mentioned in the graph analysis. To improve, the written response should provide a clear overview of the graph analysis, highlighting the main points such as the location, types of estates, and railway lines.

**Key feature selection**: The written response selects features that are not present in the graph analysis. For example, the response mentions shopping malls, city centre, river, and golf course, which are not mentioned in the graph analysis. To improve, the written response should focus on the key features identified in the graph analysis, such as the types of estates, railway lines, and their intersections.

**Data accuracy**: The written response does not accurately represent the data points presented in the graph analysis. The graph analysis shows a distribution of estates and a railway system in the north, while the written response discusses shopping malls in Brandfield, which is a different location.

**Trend description completeness**: The written response does not attempt to describe any trends or patterns in the data. To improve, the written response should attempt to describe any trends or patterns in the data, such as the varying distribution of estates and the intersection of railway lines.

Suggestions for improvement:

* Provide a clear overview of the graph analysis, highlighting the main points such as location, types of estates, and railway lines.
* Focus on the key features identified in the graph analysis, such as types of estates, railway lines, and their intersections.

**Task Achievement: 6**

The written response does not fully address the requirements of the task. The graph shows the amount of money spent on various categories of items over time, but the response writes about a map of two possible sites for a shopping mall in the city of Brandfield. This task requires descriptions of the graph, but the response does not attempt to do so. However, the response does provide some general information about the sites, such as their location and proximity to other features. (Comment 1: The response does not provide a clear overview of the graph, as required. Comment 2: The task is about describing a graph, not a map. Comment 3: The response misses the main point of the task, which is to analyze the graph.)

**Coherence and Cohesion: 5**

The response lacks coherence and cohesion. The ideas are jumbled and do not flow logically. The response jumps abruptly from discussing the two sites to the location of the river, which is not relevant to the task. The response does not use cohesive devices effectively, and the writing is repetitive and lacks progression. (Comment 1: The response lacks a clear overview of the main trends, differences or stages. Comment 2: The transition between paragraphs is unclear. Comment 3: The response could be more fully extended to provide more detail and examples.)

**Lexical Resource: 4**

The response uses a limited range of vocabulary. The writing is plain and lacks sophistication. The response relies heavily on general words and phrases, without using more precise and technical terms. The response also lacks variety in sentence structure, which further contributes to its low score. (Comment 1: The response uses only a limited range of vocabulary. Comment 2: The writing lacks precision and technical terms. Comment 3: The response could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language.)

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 4**

The response has some grammatical errors, including errors in word formation, spelling, and punctuation. The writing lacks complexity and variety in sentence structure. The response often uses simple sentences and lacks subordinate clauses. (Comment 1: The response has frequent errors in grammar and punctuation. Comment 2: The writing lacks complexity and variety in sentence structure. Comment 3: The response could benefit from more varied and precise sentence structures.)

Overall, this response would receive a score of 4.","Here's the grammatical analysis of the Task 1 response:

**Tense usage for trends: 80%**

The response uses a mix of tenses, including present simple (e.g., ""The map illustrates"") and past simple (e.g., ""runs"", ""has""). However, there is no explicit trend analysis or discussion of future changes. To improve, the response could incorporate a discussion of how the trends or changes in the city's development might impact the choice of site.

**Comparative structures: 90%**

The response uses comparative structures effectively to describe the differences between the two possible sites (e.g., ""just by the railway line and fairly close to the city centre, but it is near to an industrial estate rather than housing""). However, the response could benefit from more explicit comparisons between the two sites, such as using ""more"" or ""less"" to describe the differences.

**Passive voice: 60%**

The response uses passive voice sparingly, mainly to describe events that are not the focus of the discussion (e.g., ""The railway line runs""). However, in some cases, the passive voice can make the writing unclear or ambiguous (e.g., ""It will be next to a large housing estate""). To improve, the response could aim to use active voice more frequently.

**Articles with data: 70%**

The response uses articles effectively to describe the city and its features (e.g., ""the city centre"", ""the river""). However, in some cases, the articles could be replaced with more specific or descriptive language (e.g., ""the central business district"" or ""the town's watercourse"").

**Prepositions with trends: 80%**

The response uses prepositions effectively to describe the relationships between the city, the sites, and the features (e.g., ""just north of the city centre"", ""next to a large housing estate""). However, in some cases, the prepositions could be rephrased to make the writing more concise or clear (e.g., ""near"" instead of ""just by the"").

**Additional comments:**

* The response could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the city and its features (e.g., using adjectives to describe the size or proximity of features).
* The response could incorporate more specific and technical language related to urban planning and development (e.g., using terms like ""infrastructure"" or ""mixed-use development"").
* The response could be organized more clearly, with separate paragraphs or sections dedicated to each site or feature.","Here's the analysis of the vocabulary used in the response:

**Language for describing trends:**
The response does not explicitly describe trends, but it does provide information about the location and surroundings of two possible sites for a shopping mall. To improve, the response could describe trends, such as the proximity of both sites to the city centre, the railway line, and the main road.

**Comparison vocabulary:**
There is no explicit comparison vocabulary used in the response. To improve, the response could use comparatives and superlatives to compare the two sites, such as ""S1 is closer to the city centre than S2"" or ""S2 is more suitable for those living in the industrial estate.""

**Data reporting vocabulary:**
The response is primarily descriptive in nature and does not include data reporting vocabulary. To improve, the response could include statistics or data that support the descriptions, such as ""According to the city's master plan, 70% of the city's residents live in the north, making S1 a more appealing location.""

**Graph/chart-specific terminology:**
There is no graph or chart mentioned in the response. To improve, the response could incorporate relevant terminology, such as ""The map illustrates the two possible sites, with S1 located near the intersection of the railway line and the main road.""

Suggestions for improvement with examples in similar contexts:

* Use comparatives and superlatives to compare sites: ""S1 is the most accessible location due to its proximity to the city centre and the railway line, while S2 is more suitable for those living in the industrial estate.""
* Incorporate data reporting vocabulary: ""According to the city's traffic report, the main road experienced a 20% increase in traffic volume last year, making it a prime location for the shopping mall.""
* Use language for describing trends: ""Both sites benefit from the proximity to the city centre, but S1's location near the railway line makes it a more appealing option for commuters.""
* Incorporate graph/chart-specific terminology: ""The map illustrates the two possible sites, with S1 located near the intersection of the railway line and the main road, making it a more accessible location.""","Here's the analysis of the key features identified in the graph analysis and how they were covered in the written response:

**Overview presence and quality**: The written response provides no overview of the graph, its contents, or its purpose. There is no summary of the main findings or trends. It's unclear what the graph is supposed to convey or what insights it offers.

**Key feature selection**: The written response focuses entirely on the two possible sites for a shopping mall in the city of Brandfield, describing their locations and potential advantages. It does not mention or discuss any of the graph's key features, such as the categories of expenses, trends, or percentage changes.

**Data accuracy**: Since the written response does not discuss the graph, there is no opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of any data or statistics presented.

**Trend description completeness**: The written response does not discuss any trends or patterns in the data, nor does it provide any insights into the graph's findings. It's unclear what insights the graph offers or what implications these might have for the reader.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Begin with a brief overview of the graph's contents, purpose, and key findings to help the reader understand its significance.
2. Select the most relevant and important key features from the graph analysis, such as the notable increases and decreases in spending, and discuss them in the written response.
3. Use the graph to explore trends and patterns in the data, and provide insights into what these trends might mean for the reader.",2024-11-13 21:09:09
